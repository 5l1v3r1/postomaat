and make sure the directory of the target log file exists.

Copy the file "postomaat.service" to the system units directory selecting
the correct service file from the startscripts folder in the postomaat
installation directory.

If the daemon does not run:
* check configuration and solve all issues
  > postomaat --lint
* check if daemon is running and start if needed
  > systemctl status postomaat.service
  > systemctl start postomaat.service
* If the deamon does not start and no problem is displayed
  at startup
  > systewmctl start postomaat.service
  or using the command to check the configuration
  > postomaat --lint
  try not to run postomaat as a daemon by setting "daemonize=0"
  in "postomaat.conf". This might show error messages like
  log - file writing errors which are otherwise not displayed
  due to the forking of the daemon process.
